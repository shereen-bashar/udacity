## 📖 Session 14
This session includes a database schema for a student-course enrollment system and a set of SQL queries to retrieve data based on different conditions.

### 🛠️ Database Type
This session uses **PostgreSQL** for all queries and schema creation.

You can test the queries online at: [OneCompiler - PostgreSQL](https://onecompiler.com/postgresql/43ccmazkv)
